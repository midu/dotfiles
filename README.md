### My config

It probably will look silly to you, but right now, I like it.

### Install

```sh
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:midu/dotfiles.git
```

### Zsh

Based on [Oh My Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) :heart: You'll need to install this first.

#### Setup

```sh
echo 'source ~/dotfiles/.zshrc' >> ~/.zshrc
```

done.
